In this project we exteacted data from Kiva's website as well as the World Bank website to compile a database that consists of the information from both sites for the Central American Countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras.  

We cleaned the data in Jupyter Notebook and set up our database in PGAdmin.  Once the data was clean and merged we loaded the data into our database via Pandas.
