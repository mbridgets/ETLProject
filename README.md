In this project we extracted data from Kiva's website as well as the World Bank website to compile a database that consists of the information from both sites for the Central American Countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras.  The shrink_csv file was used to clean the KIVA data locally to include only the four countries included in our dataset. 

We cleaned the data in Jupyter Notebook to clean each data set.  The code in the queries file can be used to create the tables for each dataset and merge them together. Once the data was clean and merged, we loaded the data into our database via Pandas.
